What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    You can start saving the status of the files inside it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is a temporary area where you can choose which files to be commited to the repository, without having to commit all the files.
